### About me

I'm 34 years old. I work as a railway engineer. I stopped developing at my current job and the prospects that I see do not suit me. I prefer mental work to physical work. I want my brain to work constantly, throughout my life. That's why I'm here. My goal is to gain knowledge in the field of front-
end and back-end development.
